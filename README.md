# Sentiment Analaysis Deployment
# The Stream_lit.py file deploys the ML model
# Use the command "streamlit run <filename>" which in this case is "streamlit_app.py"
# Afterwards it will direct you a website and from their user can give input to the model and get an output
# The output will be Positive or Negative
